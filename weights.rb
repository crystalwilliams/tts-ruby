# A gym has hired you to solve a problem. Most of their clients are fairly new to weightlifting and donâ€™t know what to put on the barbell for a particular weight. The weights they have made available are in 45, 35, 25, 15, 10 and 5 lbs. increments.

# Build them a Ruby application that will tell them, for a given weight, what plates to put on each side of the bar.

#



# get a weight from the user
puts "How much weight would you like to put on the bar?"
  weight = gets.chomp.to_i


# # subtract 45 from the weight, check to see if the weight is divisible by 2, and maybe ends with a 5 or 0
# # Bear in mind that the bar itself weighs 45 lbs.

  # list the total for each section and the 45lb bar.



# calculate the amount of individual plates required for each side
# weights available are 45s, 35s, 25s, 15s, 10s, 5s.


# double the amount calculated for each side






# For example, if they want to load 225 lbs. on the bar, they will need to put two 45 lbs. plates on each side of the bar. 45x4 = 180 lbs. Plus 45 lbs. for the barbell itself equals a total of 225 lbs.









# Hint: You don't really need to create Objects for this one, so you get a break from that. But you will need to create methods!
